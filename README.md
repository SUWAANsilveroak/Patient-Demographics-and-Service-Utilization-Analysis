# Hospital Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hospital data to uncover key insights related to patient demographics, medical conditions, spending patterns, and treatment costs. By identifying patterns such as age-related trends, gender distributions, and cost variations across conditions, the analysis aims to provide actionable insights to optimize hospital services, manage resources efficiently, and enhance patient care.

## Key Findings
### 1. Gender Ratio
- The patient data shows a balanced representation of both genders, enabling unbiased analysis of healthcare trends.

### 2. Age Vulnerability
- **Age Group 75-89**: Higher vulnerability to conditions such as Cancer, Asthma, Hypertension, and Arthritis.
- **Age Groups 55-64 and 75-89**: More common cases of Obesity and Diabetes.

### 3. Medical Conditions
- The most prevalent medical conditions include:
  - **Diabetes**: 8,097 cases
  - **Arthritis**: 8,068 cases
  - **Obesity**: 8,025 cases
- These numbers highlight the burden of chronic diseases and their impact on hospital services.

### 4. Medical Condition Cost Analysis
- Significant variations were found in the costs charged for the same medical condition across hospitals.
- **Diabetes** has the highest per-day median cost, suggesting a substantial financial impact due to chronic management needs.

### 5. Average Discharge Time
- The average discharge time is consistent, indicating standardized hospital protocols and effective patient management.

## Top Hospital Performance
### Billing and Patient Analysis:
- **Johnson PLC**: Highest income at 1,063,023 with 33 patients attended.
- **Smith PLC**: Second highest income at 1,022,696 with 35 patients attended.
- **Insight**: Higher billing does not always correlate with a higher number of patients; it may reflect higher charges per patient.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of patient data and hospital practices, aiding in understanding resource allocation, cost strategies, and patient demographics. These insights can help hospitals optimize their services, manage resources more efficiently, and improve patient care.
